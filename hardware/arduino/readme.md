Looking to buy an arduino!
u/boavba
Looking to buy arduino starter kit from ebay. One that includes arduino uno, enough wires and resistors, breadboard, ultrasonic sensor, a paper guide with tutorials and exapmles, and everything else necessary to use (like motors and LEDs).

A lot of the value of these starter kits is in the instructions and projects they provide. Cheaper kits may have little to no guidance provided with them - it's up to you to decide if you want to go it alone.

Elegoo provided a CD with code samples and a PDF manual. You can download this for free off their website.

Keyestudio provided a printed manual with an online wiki for reference and sample code.

Would recommend either to a beginner.

I got a Sunfounder kit about 2 years ago which I had no complaints about.

Forget what it came with but the gist is that had an unol, cables, solid LEDs, rbg LEDs, a small dc motor, LCD display, some ICs, some of which to control the DC motor, resistors, some caps, a matrix display and segment display.

It also came with a paper book with exercises. I also believe they have a YouTube channel and an online version of the lessons.

With that said, the instructions don't tell you why the experiment works but rather on how to connect. The why is up to you to Google and read up on. Then again, that's anything that's self taught :)

Sunfounder sensor kit. I bought one for my raspberry pi and I use all the parts between my arduino and raspberry pi.
